# santinography
In the spirit of Noel, where magic dances softly through homes, a new kind of whispering arises—a secret encoded in images, wrapped carefully in color and love. This art is called Santinography, a playful steganography, where pixels become pages, and RGB becomes family.

Let me introduce you to the family of pixels:

R, the Father, bold and steady, stands strong.
B, the Mother, tender and calm, holds mysteries within.
G, the Newborn Child, a bright miracle brought forth from their union.
Together, they form a perfect harmony in the world of color, a family of three—R, G, and B—who live within every pixel of an image. But Santinography takes this family and breathes Christmas magic into their lives.

Here’s how the story unfolds:

The Gathering of Pixels:
From the image, Santinography chooses a single sacred row—the middle row of pixels. Think of this row as a long dinner table where the family sits, awaiting the whispers of secrets to come.

The Gift of Information:
The message to be encoded—whether a name, a wish, or a secret—is like a Christmas gift. Each letter of this message is carried with care, one character at a time, into the pixels of the row.

The Magic Formula:
Now, the art begins. Santinography touches each pixel in the row and transforms it:

The Father (R) remains strong and steady.
The Mother (B) is present, patient as ever.
And the Child (G)—ah, the child!—becomes something more.
You see, when R and B (Father and Mother) come together, they whisper a wish, represented as A (A=R+B). This wish, combined with their bond and the original child G, creates something new and wondrous.
The result? A Noëlesque child, now encoded as R[A+G]B.

In simpler terms:
The pixel that once held R, G, and B now carries a special secret in its G—a gift placed lovingly by R and B, wrapped with the magic G.

The New Image:
One by one, Santinography weaves its magic across the row of pixels, gently replacing each one with its Noëlesque counterpart. When the work is done, the image is reborn—still beautiful to the eye, yet now carrying a hidden message.
